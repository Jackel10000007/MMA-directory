### **Judo**

- _Focus_: Throws, trips, and ground control, with an emphasis on using leverage.
- _MMA Application_: Judo provides effective techniques for clinch takedowns and controlling an opponent in close range. Its throws and trips allow fighters to bring opponents to the ground without engaging in a full wrestling shoot, which can be useful for transitions into submission grappling.

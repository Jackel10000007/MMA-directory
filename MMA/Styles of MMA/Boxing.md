### **Boxing**

- _Focus_: Hand strikes, footwork, head movement, and timing.
- _MMA Application_: Boxing provides powerful, precise punches, along with evasive head movement and footwork for controlling range. Boxers have strong striking accuracy and defense, making them dangerous in close-range striking.

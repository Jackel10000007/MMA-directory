### **Wrestling**

- _Focus_: Takedowns, takedown defense, and control on the ground.
- _MMA Application_: Wrestling is highly valued in MMA for controlling where the fight takes place. Wrestlers excel at takedowns and preventing takedowns, allowing them to dictate whether the fight stays standing or goes to the ground. They also use ground control to wear down opponents or set up strikes.

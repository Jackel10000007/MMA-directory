### **Grappling Techniques (Offense and Defense)**

- **Offensive Techniques**:
    - _Takedowns_: Wrestling and judo techniques like double-leg and single-leg takedowns, as well as throws, allow a fighter to bring the opponent to the ground, gaining positional control.
    - _Clinch Work_: Using overhooks, underhooks, and framing to control an opponent while standing, often leading to strikes, throws, or more dominant positions.
    - _Submission Holds_: Joint locks and chokes from Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (e.g., armbars, guillotines, rear-naked chokes) force an opponent to submit by tapping out.
- **Defensive Techniques**:
    - _Takedown Defense_: Sprawling, underhooks, and strong base positioning make it difficult for an opponent to complete a takedown.
    - _Clinch Defense_: Techniques like pummeling and framing help create space, break the opponent's grip, and avoid being controlled.
    - _Counter-Wrestling_: Reversing an opponent's takedown attempts or changing positions to turn defensive grappling into offensive advantage.

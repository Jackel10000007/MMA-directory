### **Ground Fighting Techniques (Offense and Defense)**

- **Offensive Techniques**:
    - _Guard Positions_: On the ground, positions like closed guard and side control are used to control an opponent while setting up strikes or submissions.
    - _Ground and Pound_: Delivering strikes while on top to wear down or finish an opponent.
    - _Transitions and Sweeps_: Moving into better positions or flipping the opponent to gain top control or set up submissions.
- **Defensive Techniques**:
    - _Guard Retention_: Using guard positions to control the opponent from the bottom, reducing their ability to strike or pass guard.
    - _Submission Defense_: Avoiding or escaping submission holds through techniques like tucking the chin, posturing up, or peeling grips.
    - _Escapes and Reversals_: Using hip escapes (shrimping), bridging, and rolling to escape bad positions, get back to standing, or transition to a dominant position.

### **Mental Endurance**

- This is the mental resilience needed to stay focused, manage pain, and keep going despite fatigue or discomfort. Itâ€™s essential in sports like MMA, where fights can be physically and mentally grueling.
- **Training Focus**: Visualization, goal-setting, meditation, and progressively challenging workouts can enhance mental endurance. Building a strong mental game helps athletes push through tough situations and keep a clear mind for decision-making.

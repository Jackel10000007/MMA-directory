### **Muscular Endurance**

- Muscular endurance is the ability of specific muscle groups to perform repeated contractions over time without fatigue.
- **Training Focus**: Resistance training, bodyweight exercises, and circuit training help build muscular endurance. Exercises like push-ups, squats, and light-weight high-rep lifts are effective for developing muscles that can endure repetitive actions, which is crucial in MMA for sustained striking and grappling.

### **Lactate Threshold**

- Lactate threshold, or the point at which lactic acid starts to accumulate faster than it can be cleared, is crucial for endurance athletes. A higher lactate threshold allows athletes to sustain high-intensity efforts for longer before fatigue sets in.
- **Training Focus**: Interval and tempo training help improve lactate threshold, allowing an athlete to push harder for longer without feeling the effects of lactic acid build-up as quickly.

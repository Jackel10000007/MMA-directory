### **Anaerobic Endurance**

- Anaerobic endurance is the ability to sustain high-intensity efforts where oxygen availability is limited, like short, explosive movements. This is essential for bursts of power, such as quick combinations, takedowns, or sprints.
- **Training Focus**: High-intensity interval training (HIIT), sprinting, and plyometrics improve anaerobic endurance, teaching the body to perform intense bursts while managing lactic acid build-up and delaying muscle fatigue.

### Focus and Concentration

- **Mindfulness**: Being present in the moment, which helps fighters react quickly and make split-second decisions during bouts.
- **Eliminating Distractions**: Learning to ignore external distractions (e.g., crowd noise, opponent's taunts) and focus solely on the task at hand.

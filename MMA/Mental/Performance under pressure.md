### Performance Under Pressure

- **High-Stakes Environment**: Fights often occur in front of large audiences, and the pressure can be intense. Mental fortitude allows fighters to remain calm and execute their skills effectively when it matters most.
- **Handling Adversity**: During a fight, situations can change rapidly. A fighter's ability to stay focused and adapt to challenges (like being taken down or facing a stronger opponent) is critical for success.

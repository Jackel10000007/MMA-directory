### **Relative Strength**

- Relative strength refers to strength relative to body weight. It’s particularly important for athletes in weight-class sports like MMA, where having the maximum strength possible for one’s weight can be advantageous.
- **Training Focus**: Bodyweight exercises (pull-ups, dips, push-ups) and strength training with a focus on maintaining or improving lean muscle mass without adding excess weight help build relative strength. Emphasizing this type of strength ensures fighters are powerful without gaining unnecessary weight.

### **Explosive Strength (Power)**

- Explosive strength, or power, is the ability to exert maximum force in minimal time, translating strength into speed. This is crucial for movements like punching, kicking, or quickly transitioning from grappling to striking.
- **Training Focus**: Olympic lifts (e.g., cleans, snatches), plyometric exercises (e.g., jump squats, box jumps), and medicine ball throws are common for building power. These exercises combine strength and speed, training the body to deliver forceful movements rapidly.

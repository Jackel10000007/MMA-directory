### **Functional Strength**

- Functional strength is strength developed through movements that mimic real-life activities, focusing on coordination, stability, and movement patterns used in a specific sport or daily life. In MMA, functional strength helps with agility and stability in unpredictable situations.
- **Training Focus**: Compound, multi-joint exercises like kettlebell training, battle ropes, and sandbag exercises are used. Functional movements like Turkish get-ups or sled pushes also simulate real-world and fight-specific scenarios, building practical, adaptable strength.

### **Core Strength**

- Core strength is the ability of the core muscles (abs, lower back, obliques, and deeper stabilizers) to support the spine and body during movement, helping transfer power from the lower to the upper body efficiently.
- **Training Focus**: Exercises like planks, Russian twists, hanging leg raises, and anti-rotation movements (e.g., Pallof press) target the core. A strong core is essential in MMA for balance, posture, and power in strikes and grappling.

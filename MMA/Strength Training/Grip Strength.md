### **Grip Strength**

- Grip strength is essential in grappling sports, as a strong grip aids in controlling an opponent, especially in clinches or submissions.
- **Training Focus**: Exercises like farmer’s carries, dead hangs, rope climbs, and wrist curls improve grip strength. Grip training is highly relevant in MMA, where maintaining control over an opponent’s limbs or preventing escapes is often critical.

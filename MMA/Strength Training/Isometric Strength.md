### **Isometric Strength**

- Isometric strength is the ability to hold a position or resist force without moving the muscle length, crucial for maintaining control and stability in static holds, such as clinch or grappling situations in MMA.
- **Training Focus**: Exercises like wall sits, plank holds, isometric pull-ups, and dead hangs train the muscles to sustain tension without movement. Isometric strength helps athletes maintain positions under pressure, especially during close contact or in defensive situations.

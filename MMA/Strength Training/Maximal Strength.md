### **Maximal Strength**

- Maximal strength is the maximum amount of force a muscle or group of muscles can produce in a single effort. This is often measured in exercises like squats, deadlifts, or bench presses.
- **Training Focus**: Low-rep, high-weight exercises (e.g., 1–5 reps at 85–100% of maximum load) are used to develop maximal strength. Rest between sets is also longer to allow full recovery. Building maximal strength is important for MMA fighters for explosive power and overall muscle recruitment.

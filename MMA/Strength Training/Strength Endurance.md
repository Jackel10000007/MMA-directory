### **Strength Endurance**

- Strength endurance is the ability of muscles to perform repeated contractions at submaximal force over extended periods. This is especially useful in sports where muscles are repeatedly activated over several rounds or sessions.
- **Training Focus**: Higher-rep, moderate-weight exercises (e.g., 12â€“20 reps or circuit training) improve strength endurance. Exercises like kettlebell swings, bodyweight movements, and high-rep weight training are commonly used. Strength endurance is vital in MMA to keep muscles engaged and powerful throughout the entire fight.
